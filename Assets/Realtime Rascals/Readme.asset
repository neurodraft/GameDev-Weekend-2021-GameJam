    text: The Realtime Rascals assets were designed to allow creators to download,
      extend or customize them. This creates the potential for creators to use the
      Realtime Rascals to create their own stories without the need for a large team
      or big studio infrastructure such as render farms. The Realtime Rascals were
      also created so professionals can experiment on how to integrate Unity into
      their current offline pipelines and enhance creativity and productivity using
      Realtime Technology.
